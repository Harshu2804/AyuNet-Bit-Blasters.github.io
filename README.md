Problem Statement:

Nabha and its surrounding rural areas face critical healthcare challenges. The local Civil Hospital operates at less than 50% staff capacity, with only 11 doctors for 23 sanctioned posts. Patients from 173 villages often travel long distances, missing work and wages, only to discover that specialists are unavailable or essential medicines are out of stock. Poor road conditions and sanitation further restrict access. As a result, many residents lack timely medical care, leading to avoidable health complications, financial strain, and overall community distress.

-> Why This Problem Needs to Be Solved:
This issue directly affects the health, income, and quality of life of thousands of rural residents, especially farmers and daily-wage earners who cannot afford delays or repeated travel. Strengthening healthcare access in Nabha would:

1.Reduce preventable illnesses and complications.
2.Save time and income lost to unnecessary travel.
3.Improve trust in the public healthcare system.
4.Create a scalable model for other underserved rural regions in India.

-> Expected Outcomes:
1. Multilingual Telemedicine App – Video consultations with specialists available remotely.
2.Digital Health Records (Offline Accessible) – Patients can carry health data even without reliable internet.
3.Medicine Availability Tracker – Real-time updates from local pharmacies and Civil Hospital dispensary.
4.AI-Powered Symptom Checker – Optimized for low-bandwidth rural networks.
5.Scalability – A replicable framework for other rural districts.

-> Supporting Data

2.Only 31% of rural Punjab households have internet access → need for offline-first solutions.
3.Telemedicine adoption in India is growing at 31% CAGR (2020–2025), showing feasibility.
