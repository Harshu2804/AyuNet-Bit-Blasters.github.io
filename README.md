"AyuNet" â€“ An integrated digital platform for emergency response and Public Health 
India struggles with two persistent healthcare issues: slow and uncoordinated emergency response (ambulance routing, hospital bed availability) and insufficient preventive health systems (outbreak monitoring, vaccination drives, and rural access). These gaps often cause preventable deaths, strain on medical infrastructure, and delayed government interventions. AyuNet is designed to directly tackle these issues.
